# IoT-Security-Navigator

## Let's start

Download and open both files (under: code --> download ZIP).\
The html file will give you a brief (but ugly) overview over the purpose of the navigator.\
You will see, that the query is a result of the role, level, building and application filter you select on the GUI.\

If you open the xlsx file you will find a list of policies, norms and guidelines that are already categorized for the criteria mentioned above.

## First steps

- I suggest that you think about how to model the data (that ugly spreadsheet), such that it will allow a webserviceyou to work with it as a database.\
- Include the fact that the database should be expandable.\

- Design a GUI.

- Think about the roles for the tool, e.g: 
  - admin (tech db guru) 
  - power user (non-tech who maintains and updates the tool via gui)
  - user (non-tech who uses GUI for query)

## Further steps

- Is it possible to create new criteria for new elements in the db?
- Search feature

## Super bonus points
- Intelligent document classification with NLP :)
